Usage:
bin/spark-submit <path to the application> <input-file> <no. of iterations>

Example:
bin/spark-submit /home/ubuntu/Question1.py /user/ubuntu/input_data/web-BerkStan.txt 10


Here we developed a page rank algorithm using python. The implementation is same for Question1 and Question2. 
Question3 has a different implementation.

Some of the decisions taken were:
a) There are two ways to partition the RDD. We first analyzed the performance with just using the "repartition()" on links RDD. 
Next, we varied the "default.parallelism" config parameter. We eventually decided to use both together in our application.
b) Caches were dropped in all 4 VMs between successive iterations.
